                    <h3>PANDA</h3>
                    <p>A panda (also called a giant panda) is a large, gentle mammal known for its black and white fur
                         and love of bamboo. Pandas are native to the mountain forests of China, and they are part of the bear family.
    Scientific name: Ailuropoda melanoleuca Pandas mostly bamboo (they eat up to 12–38 kg per day!), but sometimes 
    small animals or eggs. They stay in cool, wet mountain forests in central China.They are about the size of a large 
    dog—can weigh up to 135 kg (300 lbs) Lifespan: Around 20 years in the wild; longer in zoos </p>
                        <p>Baby pandas are born blind, pink, and tiny—about the size of a stick of butter (around 100 grams).
                             The mother has to care for the cub nonstop.Great Climbers and Swimmers
Pandas may look clumsy, but they can climb trees and swim very well, especially when escaping predators or finding food.
Unique "Thumb" Pandas have a special wrist bone that acts like a thumb—it helps them grip bamboo while eating.
Pandas make lots of sounds, like bleats, growls, honks, and even squeaks—but they don’t roar like other bears.
Pandas communicate by leaving scent marks on trees and rocks using glands under their tails.</p>
