                    <h3>GORILLA</h3>
                    <p>Humans’ Close Cousins
Gorillas share about 98–99% of their DNA with humans, making them one of our closest relatives in the animal world.
There are two main species: the Eastern Gorilla and the Western Gorilla, and each has two subspecies—like the Mountain Gorilla,
which is the most famous and critically endangered.Gorillas are very peaceful and shy, especially compared to how they're shown in movies.
They are usually calm and only aggressive if threatened. Gorillas use more than 20 types of vocalizations, along with facial expressions and body language to communicate. 
Some in captivity have even been taught basic sign language! Adult male gorillas can weigh between 140–200 kg (310–440 lbs) and stand up to 1.8 meters (5.9 feet) tall when upright.
Females are about half the size. Gorillas walk on all fours using their knuckles—this is called knuckle-walking, a trait they share with chimpanzees and orangutans.
Gorillas are herbivores and eat mostly leaves, fruits, stems, and shoots—yet they are incredibly strong, with adult males being up to 10 times stronger than a human. 
Gorillas face threats from habitat destruction, poaching, and disease. Some subspecies, like the Mountain Gorilla, have fewer than 1,100 individuals left in the wild.</p>
                        <p>Gorillas live in groups called troops or bands, usually led by one dominant male called a silverback, named for the silver hair on his back as he matures.</p>
                            <p>Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including
    savannahs, forests, deserts and marshes. They prefer to stay near water.</p>
                                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                                 <p>You will find the gorillas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
