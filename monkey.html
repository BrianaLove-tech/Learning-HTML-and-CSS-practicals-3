                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>Monkeys are divided into two groups: New World monkeys (from Central & South America)
                         Old World monkeys (from Africa & Asia) New World monkeys often have gripping tails, 
                         while Old World monkeys don’t! Monkeys are very intelligent. Some species can use tools,
                        solve puzzles, and even learn sign language in captivity! Many monkeys have prehensile tails
                        (especially New World monkeys), which act like a fifth limb to swing and grab things.</p>
                        <p>Monkeys use calls, facial expressions, and body movements to communicate. 
                            Some species have alarm calls that warn others about specific predators—like snakes or eagles!
                        Monkeys live in groups called troops, which help protect them from predators. Troops have complex 
                        social structures with leaders and rules.There are over 260 species of monkeys, including the howler
                         monkey (the loudest), the mandrill (the most colorful), and the capuchin (very clever!).</p>
                            <p>Many monkeys are great climbers and leapers. Some can leap as far as 10 meters (33 feet) in a single jump!
Sadly, many monkey species are endangered due to deforestation, hunting, and the illegal pet trade. Conservation is key to protecting them.</p>
                                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                                 <p>You will find the Monkeys at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
