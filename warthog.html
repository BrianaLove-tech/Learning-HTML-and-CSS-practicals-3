                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>A warthog is a wild member of the pig family found in Africa, known for its tusks, warty face, and crazy-looking hair. Even though they look a bit scary, 
                        warthogs are actually shy and smart animals that prefer to run away rather than fight.
                    Warthogs have large facial warts (which are actually protective bumps) and long, curved tusks—but they’re tougher than they look!
                    Warthogs use their tusks for digging, fighting, and defending themselves from predators like lions, hyenas, and leopards.
                    Warthogs often kneel on their front knees when grazing. They even have thick pads on their knees to make it easier!
                    Don’t let their chunky bodies fool you—they can run up to 48 km/h (30 mph) to escape predators.</p>
                        <p>Home in a Burrow Warthogs live in underground burrows, often taken over from aardvarks. They usually back in, so they can charge out if attacked.
Warthogs mainly eat grass, roots, fruit, and bark, but will also dig for bulbs and tubers with their snouts.
Female warthogs, called sows, raise their piglets in the safety of burrows and are very protective of them.
Warthogs enjoy water and can swim well if needed—though they mostly live in dry savannahs and grasslands.
The most famous warthog is probably Pumbaa from The Lion King—he’s silly but actually based on a real, clever animal!</p>

                                 <p>You will find the warthog at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
