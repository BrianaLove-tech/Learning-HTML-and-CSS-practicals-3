                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas are often called “koala bears,” but they’re not bears at all. They’re marsupials, meaning they carry their babies in a pouch, like kangaroos.
                        Koalas sleep for about 18 to 22 hours a day! Their diet of eucalyptus leaves is low in energy, so they rest a lot to save strength.
                        Koalas have fingerprints just like humans—so similar that even under a microscope, they can be hard to tell apart! Koalas are listed as vulnerable,
                         mainly due to deforestation, bushfires, and disease (like chlamydia). Their homes—eucalyptus forests—are disappearing fast.
                         Koalas have a strong sense of smell to help them pick the best eucalyptus leaves. Males also have a scent gland on their chest to mark trees.
                        Koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves, which are toxic to most animals. But koalas have a special digestive system that filters out the toxins.</p>

                            A baby koala is called a joey. When born, it’s about the size of a jellybean and climbs into its mother’s pouch, staying there for about 6 months.
                            Special poop-eating phase,Joeys go through a stage where they eat a substance called “pap”, a soft poop from the mother that helps them digest eucalyptus.</p>

                                 <p>You will find the koalas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
