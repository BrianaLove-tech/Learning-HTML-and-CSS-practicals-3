                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>Lions are apex predators, meaning they are at the top of the food chain. But they sometimes lose kills to hyenas or other lions.
                        Lions have a strong bite—enough to crush bones and bring down large prey, using their sharp claws and strong jaws. Lions are classified as vulnerable.
                         Their populations are shrinking due to habitat loss, poaching, and conflict with humans. Fewer than 20,000 wild lions remain in Africa today.
                        Lion cubs are born blind and rely on their mothers completely. They start eating meat at around 8 weeks old but nurse until about 6 months.
                         A lion’s roar can be heard up to 8 km (5 miles) away! They roar to mark territory, communicate, and warn rivals.</p>
                        <p>Lions rest and sleep for about 16–20 hours a day! This helps them save energy for short bursts of explosive speed and power when hunting or fighting
                            In a pride, it’s the females who do most of the hunting, working together to stalk and chase prey like zebras, buffalo, and wildebeest. Only male lions grow thick manes,
                             which make them look larger and help protect their neck during fights. A darker mane often means a stronger, more dominant lion.</p>
                                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                                 <p>You will find the Lions at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
