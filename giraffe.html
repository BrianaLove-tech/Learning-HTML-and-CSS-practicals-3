                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffes silent giants they are generally quiet, but they do make sounds—including grunts, snorts, moos, and even
 humming at night (possibly to communicate with each other while it's dark).
 Giraffes barely sleep they only sleep about 4 to 5 hours a day, often in short naps that last a few minutes.
 In the wild,they usually sleep standing up to avoid predators.Tallest Animals on Earth
Giraffes can grow up to 5.5 meters (18 feet) tall. Their necks alone can be around 2.4 meters (8 feet) long!</p>
                        <p>They have the same number of neck bones as humans.Even though their necks are super long,
 giraffes have just 7 neck vertebrae, the same number as humans! Each vertebra is just much longer.
Their tongues are like tools.A giraffe's tongue can be up to 45–50 cm (18–20 inches) long—and it's dark purple or bluish-black to prevent sunburn.
 They use it to grab leaves, especially from thorny trees like acacias.</p>  
                            <p>Giraffes are classified as vulnerable, with some subspecies listed as endangered, mainly due to habitat loss and poaching.
                                Despite their awkward look, giraffes can run up to 56 km/h (35 mph) over short distances!</p>

                                 <p>You will find the Giraffes at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
